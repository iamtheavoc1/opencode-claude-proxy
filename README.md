# opencode-claude-proxy

The repository name is historical. The current fix does **not** run a local Claude proxy — it installs Anthropic auth wiring plus a self-healing token recovery patch on top of `@ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth`.

One-command fix so [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) bills Anthropic calls against your Claude Pro/Max subscription instead of the misleading `"You're out of extra usage"` error.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamtheavoc1/opencode-anthropic-auth-fix/main/fix-opencode.sh | bash
```

Re-runnable, idempotent, backs up `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` before touching it. Works with the OAuth session your `claude login` already set up — no `setup-token`, no API key, no new auth flow.

You do **not** need to fetch a token manually. Run `claude login` once, run the one-line installer, and OpenCode will reuse that session. It refreshes its own token automatically, and if OpenCode's stored refresh token goes stale while Claude CLI is still logged in, the patched plugin re-syncs from Claude CLI locally.

After it runs, restart OpenCode and you're done:

```bash
pkill -x opencode 2>/dev/null; opencode
```

## The root cause — what's actually broken

Writing this down because I wasted hours on the wrong theory and every plugin and blog post on the internet gets it wrong.

**Anthropic's `/v1/messages` API validates the `system[]` array for OAuth requests.** For requests billed against the Claude Code subscription pool, `system[]` is allowed to contain exactly one thing: the identity block (`"You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK."`). Any additional entries — OpenCode's agent prompts, OhMyOpenCode's Sisyphus configuration, tool descriptions, workspace memory blocks, cache control markers — trigger an HTTP 400 whose error body is:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "You're out of extra usage. Add more at claude.ai/settings/usage and keep going."
  }
}
```

**That error message is completely misleading.** The "extra usage" pool isn't the problem. Your subscription pool has plenty of headroom. What Anthropic is actually saying is "your `system[]` is not an attributable Claude Code session", and the fact that it surfaces as an extra-usage error is a billing-classification quirk.

What's *not* the problem (despite every other plugin patching these):

- `x-anthropic-billing-header` values (`cc_version=X.Y.Z.hash; cc_entrypoint=cli; cch=hash`) — Anthropic computes `cch` as a per-request hash of your prompt, but any value works here as long as the header is present.
- The user-agent string (`claude-cli/2.1.100 (external, cli)`)
- The `anthropic-beta` flag list
- The x-stainless-* SDK headers
- The OAuth scopes
- Using `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` vs keychain session tokens

What *is* the problem: `system[]` must have exactly the identity block and nothing else. Everything else belongs in the user message.

## How the fix works

`fix-opencode.sh` installs [`@ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth), which has a `rewriteRequestBody()` function that transparently relocates every non-identity system block to `messages[0].content` before forwarding to Anthropic:

```js
// From the plugin's transform.js — this is the entire fix
// Anthropic's API validates system[] content for OAuth requests.
// Third-party system prompts trigger a 400 rejection when they
// appear in system[]. Keep only the identity block in system[]
// and prepend everything else to the first user message.
```

So OpenCode keeps building its multi-block system prompts the normal way, the plugin rewrites the body on the fetch boundary, and Anthropic sees a valid shape. Your OpenCode agents and OMO orchestrators work unchanged.

## What the installer does

1. Verifies `claude` CLI, `npm`, `git`, `python3`, and (optionally) `opencode` are reachable. Falls back to common install locations (`~/.bun/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`) so it works even when run via `curl | bash` in a subshell that doesn't inherit your interactive PATH.
2. Downloads `@ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth` via `npm pack` (no global install, no root, no side effects on your npm prefix).
3. Extracts it to `~/.local/share/opencode-anthropic-auth/`.
4. Patches the installed plugin so auth is less brittle:
   - refreshes within 60 seconds of expiry instead of waiting until the token is already dead
   - if OpenCode's refresh token is stale but your local `claude` CLI is still logged in, locally borrows a fresh Claude CLI bearer token and keeps the request flowing
5. Backs up `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` to `opencode.json.bak.<timestamp>`.
6. Rewrites the config to:
   - register the plugin via `file://` reference
   - strip `opencode-claude-bridge` and `opencode-claude-code-plugin` from the `plugin` list (both cause the extra-usage error)
   - strip `claude-proxy` and `claude-code` provider entries (both superseded)
   - set the default model to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` if none is set, or if the existing default pointed at one of the removed providers

Existing keys, other plugins, and other providers are preserved. The rewrite is JSON-safe (done in Python, not sed).

## Requirements

| Tool | Why | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**Claude CLI**](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) | Provides the OAuth session the plugin reuses. | Follow the docs, then `claude login`. |
| **Claude Pro or Max subscription** | Without one there's nothing to bill against. | [claude.ai/upgrade](https://claude.ai/upgrade) |
| [**OpenCode**](https://opencode.ai) | The thing we're patching. | Follow the install instructions at opencode.ai. |
| **npm** | Downloads the plugin from the npm registry. Ships with Node.js. | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **python3** | Rewrites `opencode.json` safely. | Preinstalled on macOS and most Linux distros. |
| **git** | Used by the installer's sanity checks. | Xcode Command Line Tools / your package manager. |

## Verification

Verified end-to-end on a real machine — **not** an isolated probe — by running the exact path that was consistently failing:

```bash
opencode run "say exactly: FIXED_FOR_REAL" --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

through OhMyOpenCode's **Sisyphus (Ultraworker)** agent orchestrator (which attaches a large multi-block system prompt), the model returned `FIXED_FOR_REAL`, the bridge debug log showed **two HTTP 200 responses** from Anthropic, and the TUI had zero errors. Before the fix, the same command produced `"You're out of extra usage"` on the first turn every single time.

## Troubleshooting

**Still seeing `"out of extra usage"` after running the installer.**
OpenCode caches plugins in memory — the running TUI didn't reload. Kill it and relaunch:

```bash
pkill -x opencode 2>/dev/null; opencode
```

**Getting `Token refresh failed: 400 — {"error":"invalid_grant", ...}`.**
That means OpenCode's stored refresh token is stale. The installer-patched plugin now tries to self-heal by borrowing a fresh bearer token from your local `claude` CLI login. If `claude` is still logged in, the next request should recover automatically.

If you instead see `invalid authentication credentials`, that usually means the cached OpenCode access token is no longer accepted even though its stored expiry timestamp hasn't elapsed yet. The installer-patched plugin now detects that live request failure, re-syncs a fresh bearer token from your local `claude` CLI session, writes it back to OpenCode's auth cache, and retries the request automatically.

If it still fails, either `claude` itself is logged out or both auth stores are stale. Re-auth once and you're back:

```bash
claude login
```

If OpenCode keeps holding onto a bad auth record after that, clear just the Anthropic entry and let the plugin rebuild from the next request:

```bash
python3 -c 'import json,os; p=os.path.expanduser("~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json"); a=json.load(open(p)); a.pop("anthropic", None); json.dump(a, open(p, "w"), indent=2)'
```

**Running the installer overwrote my default model.**
It only replaces the default if it was unset or pointed at a removed provider (`claude-code/*` or `claude-proxy/*`). Your backup is at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json.bak.<timestamp>` — copy the `"model"` field back if you need to.

**The plugin got an npm update, how do I reapply?**
Re-run the same curl command. It's idempotent and picks up the latest version on each run.

## Token lifecycle

The plugin reuses the OAuth token OpenCode already has at `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`. On every `/v1/messages` call it:

1. Checks the `expires` timestamp.
2. If within ~1 minute of expiry, POSTs to `https://platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` with `grant_type=refresh_token` and swaps in a fresh access+refresh pair atomically.
3. If that refresh fails with `invalid_grant` but your local Claude CLI login is still alive, it spins up a loopback capture, asks `claude` for a local request, grabs the current bearer token, and writes that back into OpenCode's auth cache.
4. Retries twice on network errors (500ms, then 1s backoff).
5. Writes the rotated/recovered tokens back to `auth.json`.

Under normal use the refresh cycle runs forever and you never notice. If the OpenCode refresh token dies but `claude login` is still valid, the plugin now recovers automatically. If both are stale, you need to log back into Claude CLI once.

## Credits

The actual fix — the `rewriteRequestBody` logic that relocates non-identity system blocks — is in [`@ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth) by [ex-machina-co](https://github.com/ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth). Huge thanks to [@juliancoy](https://github.com/juliancoy) for figuring out the `system[]` validation and publishing the plugin. This repo is just a one-command installer that wires it into OpenCode's config correctly and rips out the broken legacy plugins.
